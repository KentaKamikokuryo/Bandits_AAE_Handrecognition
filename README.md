# Bandits_AAE_Handrecognition

# DEMO
 
This demonstration uses Oculus Rift S data for analysis.

For visualizing the analyzed Data, model as Adversarial Auto Encoder is used.

For Dynamical Difficulty Adjustment, model as Bandits model with Kalman filter is used.

In search, the model is optimized from a bunch of models and hyperparameters.
 
# Requirement
 
* Python 3.8
* This environment can be built using .yml file.
 
Environments under [Anaconda for Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is tested.
